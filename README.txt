# Fall

Game by: Oaty (@DevPatF) And Known_esoteriC

Climb as high as possible while collecting wings and avoiding the ever consuming Hell-maw.

## How to play

Click and drag to start aiming a launch, release the click when ready to leap.

A game-pad may also be used. For an Xbox 360 controller, press and hold A while using the analogue stick to aim the launch. Release the A button to fling in that direction.

Collect wings to gain score.

Touching spikes or falling into the ever consuming Hell-maw will end the game.
